# OCToolbox

OCToolbox.jl aims to be a collection of fast optimal control algorithms implemented in Julia. 

## What is Optimal Control?

A selection of numerical methods which can be used to enhance our control of a quantum system in order to reach some goal.

## Why Julia?

Julia is a fast and flexible programming language designed for numerical computation making it an excellent candidate for this type of project. I think that it’ll be possible to leverage multiple dispatch to enhance things too. 

## Why another package?

There are lots of groups that are interested in this and I feel it would be useful to have reference implementations of algorithms, that are fast, to compare them against one another.

## Roadmap

There are several algorithms that I’d like to include:

- [ ] GRAPE
- [ ] GOAT
- [ ] GROUP
- [ ] dCRAB
- [ ] Krotov


## Can I help?

Yes! Please reach out to us either via email or on github if you can offer help or advice, we're new to all of this!
